# Weather API

## Quickstart

1. clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/jmmarco/ajax-weather-mini-project.git`

2. Run a local Web Server from within the project root folder
There are many ways to do this, a simple webserver [like this one](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en) will do the trick.

Note: You need a Google Chrome Webrowser. Otherwise, you'll need to find another local Web Server solution.

3. Once the webserver is up and running navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8887` to use the weather app.

**Note**: If you don't use a local webserver the API will not work due to [CORS](https://www.maxcdn.com/one/visual-glossary/cors/)
